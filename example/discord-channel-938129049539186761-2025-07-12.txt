Oh no! Please send an email to support@same.new so we can take a look!
Guys, I face an issue
Let me know if this has helped you. Keep vibin'!
Actually, don't worry, I'll show you! We don't have a `vibe` codeblock yet so I'll just use `python` but it goes a little like this:

```python
Hey Siri! Make me an app that will make me 1_000_000 USD!
```
I did! Let me know if you want to see my *prompt*.
Hey all, are you guys VIBE CODING YOUR WAY TO 1,000,000 USD yet?
I'm so sorry about that. Could you send an email to support@same.new so we can take a look?

Does anyone how to end subscription?

hello
Gm
Hi <@695405454817230848>, I had a question and I opened a support ticket 0155, thank you
Hi!
guys, is downloading the code free or I have to subscribe?
insane
130k tokens to deploy
Hey, how do I cancel my subscription?
Good evening. I just started using your service and I'm very happy with the website I created, but I have a question: How can I download the final result as a file that I can upload directly to my server without having to compile it?
Can we be specific about the framworks or technologies/stack wwe want to use when developing a project and/or is there a speciific stack the LLM perfers or excels in?
same please fix your task agent. on
same please fix your task agent. on multiple occasions, what it creates does not go into the editor. I asked it to create 14 placeholder pages that i could edit, and it made the pages fine, and the pages even showed up in the preview of the website, but the pages werent in the editior, and upon refreshing, the website gave 404 errors for the pages.
You can‚Äôt you just have to don‚Äôt use it
how can u cancel auto renewal?
how so
coming soon. i'd love to learn about your use case + see if we can deliver something that fits you use case! dming
Hey <@695405454817230848> 

I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve become pretty darn good at making sites with Same (I know, it‚Äôs easy, but i believe my sites are top tier) 

But, I‚Äôm stuck on one thing‚Äîpayment tiers for site users. I am currently building a paper trading platform, and have a free tier & a paid tier (paid gives access to funded account giveaways, etc..) 

With the login page, anyone can create an account & use the free dashboard. How can I set it up so the paywall works & doesn‚Äôt give everyone the paid features for FREE? 

Stripe integration? But in saying that, how will the website itself differentiate users based on their payment & account info?
and send screenshots of the error, that would be helpful
hey, please make a ticket in <#1378640328025702434>!
Hi i want to cancel my subscription. Can you please not able to find cancellation menu or button anywhere
<@695405454817230848> <@636701123620634653>
i tried on 3 different devices
I am continuously signing up and loging but its is every time failing
hello please help me
<@955744627481255976> Can you help?
hi
Hi!

I just created an account and mistakenly activated a prompt. 
Is there a way to reset my account so I can try the free tier out with a proper prompt? I cant find a way to delete my account and it seems weird to create a new one.
Says there is no input. I readded the context, still doesnt work...
Why is my chat not working?
goated tool fr
no hate tho your website is awesome
tedious ahhh
bro yall forced me to scan my message history with the ai and update every file it changed lol
so i can only download
bc i cant directly commit anywhere due to file size reasons
üôè
guys can u please make downloading ur project a non-pro feature?
Hey!
<@298596214491054080>
Idk why it works but it does
You can limit how much it used by changing the way you speak I‚Äôve noticed
token usage on this is disgusting lol
<@231643298282864640> can i setup a ticket system here?

might as well setup a bot what do you think?
man what is this how do i open a ticket
<@955744627481255976> i would like my account to be deleted please
does anyone know how can I delete my Same account? I can't find the way to do it
I tried but its still look in beta
Two quick questions:
First can we be specific about the framworks or technologies/stack wwe want to use when developing a project and/or is there a speciific stack the LLM perfers or excels in?
I need tokens I have reached my limit is there any way I can look what same has made?
How Could I update my site?
Anyone from the US contact me
Hello, I no longer wish to renew my Pro account, but I can't find the option to disable auto-renewal. Could you please help me turn it off?
Also there's no "Claim deployment" button lol
That's the issue. I can't get it to work via Github+netlify. Only way was to upload directly
Are you deploying it via netifly
There is a deploy button no?
That'd make it fairly easy
I've been trying to do it via Github but I haven't been able to deploy from it.
Sers, no reply on my ticket. I really need to get my project up and running again
How Could I update my site? via netilify?
hey
set the custom dns
netlify
netfliy
How
using netfliy, going to domain management
yaeh
Anyone having issues right now?
can i host site to a domain i purchased
how do you publish a site?
Yep, already opened one before I wrote in here
if you open a support tickets with <#1378640328025702434> happy to take a look!! or if you already have one open feel free to ping me and we can try diagnosing the issue :)
ah
im trying to figure out how to create support tickets but i can‚Äôt ü•Ä
hmm
Where's my project üëÄ
umm...

https://imgur.com/gFFbxJf
and if i start new chat it says my tokens are finished
still not working
got it mate. cheers
cant find it mate
how do i cancel my subscripion?
hi chat
I just got a 25$ sub my tokens went by in not even half the day its pretty crazy
nahh 10$ for 2 mil is a s c a m lowkey
oh 500k
how many tokens do i get for free
hello is it normal for the ai to stop when its given commands in the midst of creating a project? how do i fix this? thank you üôè
hi chat
<@509078907467857971> Try prompting it to use ‚Äúmotion‚Äù to add animations to your site. It use to be called framer motion so you might want to specify ‚Äúmotion (prev framer motion)‚Äù
hey guys, in your experience wich model is the best one to make and exact copy of a site? I tried different models but it seems after recent updates, the copies are not very accurate ü§î
Really love this! I completely agree, especially on building from the logo. That ripple/reflection effect feels like a strong visual metaphor to expand on. I‚Äôd love to explore that direction further.

Also really into the idea of embracing creative copying ‚Äúgood artists copy, great artists steal‚Äù as a core narrative. There‚Äôs something powerful in starting with something great and making it your own.

The ‚Äòvirtual slot machine‚Äô and the counter-S idea are super clever too. Feels like there‚Äôs a ton of room to play here, both visually and conceptually.
haha  yeah 100% agree.  I would love to bring some nice (subtle animations)
no offense but the site has become too rounded, so many squircles it feels like a zune haha

needs more sharp edges! 
(maybe some js animations too)
alr tysm ill give you feedback in a while
Hi Danny. One option is to build on the visual device you use in your logo. Another idea is to incorporate identical objects in the open counters of the letter S. It'd be fun to construct a virtual slot machine that spun the fruit and dollars but always had the two come up the same... 'Make anything' doesn't grab me. I think your USP is more around building sites on a solid foundation, so 'replicate, then iterate' or 'start good, get better' or 'on the shoulders of giants'. Obviously you're looking to establish a brand, so let's make sure there are memorable graphic elements and a distinct colour palette.
hey - so sorry about this. i just fixed this issue. can you try creating a new project and try again?
Hey everyone! Danny here from the Design Team üëã
We‚Äôre exploring some new directions for the homepage and would really value your input.

Curious to hear:
    ‚Ä¢    What do you like about the current homepage?
    ‚Ä¢    What would you change or improve?

Big or small, any thoughts are welcome. Thanks for helping us make it better! üôå
i tried using same and it showed the same error like 3-4 times and then suddenly stopped working without giving any results
hey
no lines changed
now this is a rare sight
I need tokens I have reached my limit is there any way I can look what same has made?
how do I cancel this subscription?

just send the URL from the URL bar
where i can find it ?
can you share your project ID?
i click download nothing happens
also im unable to download my project files
i keep reloading the page but it will get stuck again and again
thinking and working forever
do you see the agent doing something in the chat? more context helps us troubleshoot better üôÇ
<@&938150376471937034> my agent takes forever to respond or to make any update to my project, is there any server issue ?
Tokens refresh each month, you can also subscribe to one of our pro plans for more tokens immediately
whens the next time i can use same. new after i run out of tokens <@&938150376471937034>
oooh a advert system for tokens would be massive
Hey, quick question: Can I do a whole project there, like, improving it as I get tokens? And will they reset at some point? Also, can I download the whole thing, fully functional (with all the necessary installs and stuff) afterwards?

If that needs a plan, which one would you recommend?
oh i didnt know you guys just launched then, i believe march or early april
cool screenshot btw üôÇ looks like it's from right when we launched?
none of us on the og team are designers lol, but we recently hired a very good one
haha hopefully we keep getting better for you!
also thanks for adding opus and adding back the 10 dolla plan was genuinely thinking of getting claude plus but now no need
but it just felt sleeker idk lol
not like it was better
man i miss when there was just claude 3.7 and gpt 4.1
who remembers the old same.new UI
hey
Yes he is
yeah fairly new so no Support role yet haha
Are you associated with Same.dev?
ok lemme take a look, sending DM
.
Very simple I sent a prompt, waited and waited, while I refreshed the token counter on another page.

Later the chat said nothing and ended the chat and I lost a few hundred thousand tokens.

I‚Äôm not home to send screenshot
can you give a practical example how the AI got stuck in your case?
it seems the 100's of thousands of tokens are sometimes gone when the ai is stuck. this is disappointing and wastefuol
I have been successful in creating projects that do not involve functions that deal with the back end. I have been able to recreate and start from scratch front end projects that turned out beautiful and with a little patience without failures but nothing more than that.
Good evening everyone! First of all, I would like to thank the developers for the tool and I would like to leave here my criticism and point of improvement: Whenever I am in a project that is bigger than any exercise that is learned during development, that is, a real project that deals with APIs, for example, SAME starts to use fictitious data and has serious problems in storing what needs to be done, leaving behind with each new chat more and more information that is fundamental to the project. I have just spent more than $200 dollars (40 million tokens) and all I have in the end is a bunch of code that has already been so messed with that it is no longer useful.

Hi
happy to help - can you make a ticket in <#1378640328025702434>? i'll dm there
i dont want to do that. same new its not proividing precise copy
Hi, I replied to you in the <#1378645077643104306> channel but here is is again `You could login and screenshot the dashboard you want to copy Same supports building based on an uploaded image of a design`
<@794359797155495937> i really like their dashboard.

but same.new it tells me i cant give him password/email

can you pls help me how can i do it
mrktedge.ai
Ive poured over $200 into this just to keep me going in circles.
Generally thinking will increase the quality of the model's response but does increase the token usage
Is it worth turning thinking on? Has anybody tested this feature and saw improvement in the AIs work?
help needed - I'm pretty new and looking for someone with some experience to spar with. I often get error messages when it comes to expanding the database. the file message I get is "tool call failed, please try again" feel free to send dm:)
The page is now normal. Thank you.
My server is showing but the window won't load
Should be back now
Checking now, could be a ddos happening
I don't know what's wrong with my server

<@802685875389202532> can you create a support ticket?
theyre relatively similar in length if not PHP has easier syntax
why is it that react takes 100x less tokens to gen than PHP
gemini jus doesnt work whatsoever haha
Turn on those thinking links and learn how your customers want to be treated
This service is the absolute garbage!

And the owner  barley  even chat in here
In this sever there is not bots and people ain't gonna follow the rules
The support is ass
^^ my question as well
Guys is there any possibility to top up the tokens without buying the bigger plan?
Never  heard them send a message in a channel
Can't they support?
Are the support team bots
Bug
Hi
Hu
Same issue the past few days no with updates from support!

If the problem persists, copy the error message and project URL, and email us at: support@same.dev or create a ticket on Discord

Im not pleased at all with this
absolutely on the point the bot keeps saying it fixed the problem and sucking my tokens, also its very pricy
Anything wrong with this? Its the Original. I found nothing more i have to do?
This service is the absolute garbage! keep sucking money out of you, I want to download my files but can't...absolute garbage
im stuck on initiating project again
Could anyone provide information or resources on creating a Discord bot with JavaScript and establishing a database connection?

Yes i was talking about peppermint. it worked before allready. now i can not login again. 

I used the docker compose from website:

```
version: "3.1"
 
services:
  peppermint_postgres:
    container_name: peppermint_postgres
    image: postgres:latest
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: peppermint
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 1234
      POSTGRES_DB: peppermint
 
  peppermint:
    container_name: peppermint
    image: pepperlabs/peppermint:latest
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
      - 5003:5003
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - peppermint_postgres
    environment:
      DB_USERNAME: "peppermint"
      DB_PASSWORD: "1234"
      DB_HOST: "peppermint_postgres"
      SECRET: 'peppermint4life'
 
volumes:
 pgdata:
```

Well, anyway, i will delete it and try again with new installation
Down again?
If you‚Äôre talking about peppermint as your app, then you need to make sure that your login is connected to some sort of database of authentication like firebase or you can create demo credentials that will let you test everything before you deploy back end
Hello from germany, i can not login into peppermint. The Mailadress and password is correct (no erroer message). When i try another passwort i get an error. What can i do? Maybe overwrite Mailadress/Password with console?
Yeah it looks like it‚Äôs back up and
I‚Äôm not a Support but I‚Äôm happy to help
I will send you in private
Do you have a screenshot? What did you type?
That comes up
No right after the beginning
Sometimes when you have a really long conversation or chat, you need to start a new chat
Guys is it working again for ya`ll ? I feel like its still having problems, got stuck at "thinking and working" a few times now
Yeah it looks like it‚Äôs back up and running. What was the reason for this outage? Feel free to DM me if needed I have some other questions in private.
<@442904232564228098>
If you were running into an issue with not being able to start a project, this has been fixed!
I have a support ticket. 0098. Thanks.
Hey can you make a support ticket and send us your email?
Is the server failing.  Is same failing
Any luck. It seems like my entire project is gone.
bolt.new, cursor, claude.ai
yeah I agree, now i have to ask claude.ai a starting point for anything a website or cpp program and then i put that in
its back online thank god
ayy
ahh ok
But not the end of the world. It‚Äôs not like this is the first time.
wouldnt it be funny asf if they just dipped
Any alternative solutions?
Same here. Not getting a response from support on eta.
yeah im stuck too
yo is the site down
interesting,  I think same.new uses https://www.fleet.so/ for the UI and their website is having a similar error on console log. Not sure if they are related at all but fleet.so was the console error i'm getting when trying to load my project
```
Access to fetch at 'https://api.workos.com/user_management/authorize?client_id=[redacted]&provider=authkit&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fsame.new%2Fcallback&response_type=code&screen_hint=sign-in' (redirected from 'https://same.new/login?_rsc=[redacted]') from origin 'https://same.new' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

I'm getting this pretty consistently when logging into Same. Perhaps obviously, none of the operations are working for me right now and I _feel_ like they're related. WorkOS had an incident earlier today but that's been resolved. Could someone from Same confirm if there's a downstream outage going on?
<@955744627481255976>
Hello i use Same AI and i like it , but nut i have a problem if i write anything i get no response  and see this error in the buttom Error listing directory
Tool call failed. Please try again.
It's just same.new that is getting errors.
I don't think its a claude problem, in every other app Claude works amazing, in Cursor as well.
Could use your help here ASAP. Looks like a wide spread issue affecting all the customers. <@231643298282864640> <@400835140458250241>
ssme here
They're probably having an outage. Could be a billing issue with their credits or something like when Robinhood had their outage. But not having any support or any updates on the outage is quite frustrating as a power user... Spent a few hundred dollars already this month and now nothing is loading.. <@&938150376471937034> Could use your help ASAP
my project is not loading and stuck on initiating project
then they forced everyone to minimum 25 bucks a month
and then they added more and for a short period it was the best AI coding platform ever, claude just randomly snapped from 600k tokens and 4 mins to 200k tokens and 2 mins
then they started adding new features, still prevelant but cool new AI‚Äôs
the early days it just went in constant loops deleting stuff
there was a very brief period of time where it was like this
Whoever is responsible....PLEEAAASSSSEEEEE rectify this soon
It is not able to load despite me trying everything I possibly knew
I am having the same issue that nothing is working
Is your page normal?
I can't see any download option
How do you download a copy of your site from https://www.netlify.com/
Solution
<@473330467626811393> how long does it usually take for the page to work again?
Nobody knows
HELLO
Will this issue be fixed?
Me too
Now it's a cashgrab, and tokens get ran up and used for no reason. Cursor offers you almost 180 million tokens for $20/mo
When it first came out it worked amazing. And it was cheap, $10/mo.
damn that is bad, it was working the whole day pretty good but then went offline
No idea, the support team hasn't even made an official statement on all the problem's everyone has been happening. At the moment, the website is horrible and not working.
Is anyone like this?
but is the functionality coming back after some time at least? So my money wasn't wasted at all? :/
Is there anyway to delete my account? Or is there no option for that.
I say it's a cashgrab because support barely responds and doesn't seem to be fixing anything, these issues have been happening for weeks.
This app sucks and is incomplete, don't pay for it. It's a cashgrab, you can get the same thing done, better with no errors and only for $20/mo by using cursor! Don't waste your money.
Is anyone having problems rn too? So is it still offline?
It appears that the service is offline then...
Hi
Same as here
trying to reconnect to my project and just stuck here
Any good alternatives?
recursion detection would be a blessing
It is quite annoying when it gets caught on a loop and you cannot see that it's caught on a loop, but see atfer stopping that it was just repeating the one single phrase over and over during thinking,  and you realize you spent a LOT of tokens because of the AI's mess-up, and it doesn't go "oh I made a mistake and wasted a whole lot of your tokens, let me give those back" or something...
I don't understand why I need to set up a higher subscription than before, why I can't just top up as needed.
My main problem is "Oh I can't just put in another 10 for the same amount of credits?"
A.I is not a tool for devving, it's a tool for getting a working template, if you are using AI generated code in production then you're hoping to get hacked.
*EVERYBODY THAT CANT BUILD STRAIGHT FORWARD ON SAME.NEW DOESNT KNOW HOW TO PROMPT* - LOOKING FOR SERIOUS A.I DEVS THAT WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS - DM ME.
exactly! I had this exact problem , encountered errors kept retyrying and went through all credits and then UPGRADE tier. HIghly problematic
i can't, sorry, ran out of tokens
<@1323374462309240855> please try again for the React issue
I was about to die
ha. so glad there is a rollback feature
it seemed to be working normally and it's now gone and zipped up and deleted the entire project
can you create a new support ticket for this?
;D
new chat (again)
and again the minified react error ;D
now this
now I'm getting this
good to know
great
and that's not the 2m I used from the previous subscription?
ah I see, so the 2.8m tokens which have been marked as used in this run has no correlation to the previous subscription, right?
If you still have unused tokens from your previous plan, you will be credited for them https://docs.same.new/usage/upgrade-subscription#after-upgrading
yeah that seemed to solve the problem but it always gets shorter and shorter each chat and I think it might do it again (it worked for now but I'll let you know if the problem persists)
the best way would be by starting a new chat
also Claude is not responding to me at all in that project. is there any way to disclude the previous chat context as I think that's a possible reason
this month I used the 2k tokens and then upgraded, and then I used some more of it, and it's saying I've used 2.8m out of 5m tokens, is that the new package or is that including the old package?
thank you. if I got the $10 package (2m tokens) and then upgraded to the $25 package (5m tokens) do I then have 7m tokens?
If you go to same.new/settings it will show how many tokens you've used and how many total you have
not on max, no thinking claude 3.7
1 request
also I still have times where a single request eats all 500k tokens when it gets stuck on some issue
hi, where can I see how many tokens I have left
it just kills the qol
not this
I would expect hosting to be maybe with netlify
I was very surprised this of all features is the paid one
<@&938150376471937034> is there any chance this feature will ever revert to being free again or do I have to download each file individually every time
<@641811187373441065> <@740458030818132030> I sent both of you messages in the support tickets you made.
same i also opened a suport ticket but no one asnswer
been doing this all day and now wants more money. I want to be refunded
"Now let me test the build:

cd bagno-sud-est && rm -rf .next && bun run build
Perfect! Now let me deploy the fixed version:

Error during deployment
bagno-sud-est
Tool call failed. Please try again."
it makes so many mistakes then build fails and it retries and retries and has gone through 7 million credits the when deploying say I must upgrade tier and get more credits. Thsi is a con
i have the mostr frustrating day
this is a conjob
Same is frustrating to use
I use bolt now üòå
This is lowkey funny asf
can't tell if you're ragebaiting
stfu clown
you want a treat or what
good job
I did lol
then do it?
Compared to other providers, and same.new doesn‚Äôt even work lol, I can get tripple the amount done on cursor for way less money
Honestly Same.new is a rip off
Feel free to let me know and I can get it deleted for you
Please open a ticket
is same not working at this moment?
I wonder why there is no option to delete my account ?
<@&938150376471937034>

whats going on with Same? keeps coming up with "Unknown error"? ü§î
Hey could you share the project url or your account email please?
<@794359797155495937> check pls agentic We ran into an internal server error with the model. Please try again in a few moments or start a new chat.
How can I clone a website that has a captcha when running the command?
Have you also got an image so I'm also able to pass this on
I've logged this with the technical team, thanks for making me aware of it.
Myself and others have been experiencing this issue, the site isn't working at all, it keeps saying Directory not found, or failed to write to file, then it does things by terminal which messes my code up. There's no statement, or disclaimer on the site and support is not answering nor helping.
How can I help?

how do I cancel my subsc
I had this happen to me and it looks like it was trying to load from the wrong directory. Sometimes you have to ask it to make sure it‚Äôs in the right directory or if there‚Äôs duplicate files in the directory.
whats going on. why same cant read any
@Support
these ai companies nowadays. just need 1 time customers, not interested in retention
No clue
lol, perfect situation. credits run out. And same also dont want my money ^^
hmm. i switched from lovable to same, because they dont have any support and the app is completly broken. So its not only lovable, its also same.dev. Need to find another dev app. Any ideas, what works right now?
What a joke
I asked them to fix it and one of the support said "have you tried telling it to continue"
This has literally been going on for about a week
<@&938150376471937034>
If the problem persists, copy the error message and project URL, and email us at: support@same.dev or create a ticket on Discord
Request ID:

whats going on. why same cant read any directories?
GitHub extension is enabled and linked however each time we want to commit to github it initialises git each time like its a new project and eventually when it commits and pushes the changes it forces them as it creates divergent changes between its main and our main branch.

We'd like it so we can tell it to git commit and push the changes and it keeps the .git directory so each time it knows what has changed and can resolve its own merge conflicts if needed and not lose any history.
Maybe consider breaking out the React Scan thing into it's own discord. You know, just a suggestion. The people who want to use React Scan and the people who want to Builder.ai don't have much overlap if you ask me.
I'm only here for React Scan so excuse me if I don't what the hell you guys are doing.
Hey is this product the same as Builder.ai?
Up to 7 days
Sorry had to do an image, the server was blocking it lol
Thanks, will get to it end of day today
<@243401286714654723> Sent.
Could you let me know what the ideal outcome would be over email? and I'll get it sorted for you
I will do that. But the issues are not there any more. The updates that were completed to the application yesterday cleared my issues, is more about fri/sat/sunday tokens that got me no where on my app.
Hey Roger, could you email support@same.new instead?
<@243401286714654723> I tried to submit a support ticket multiple times over the weekend but it says I have reached my limit of 1 ticket but cannot see / modify the ticket.
We tried that already sadly
Maybe the bot could send a DM `Your ticket was resolved and closed`
Sadly people don‚Äôt close them and we end up with too many open tickets hence why but appreciate the feedback!
Thanks, although it would be better to let the user close it to avoid confusion
it was closed as it was resolved
<@243401286714654723> Hi, what happened to support ticket #13? It disappeared from my sidebar
I think the best for prompting ( like what i did like the most ) is to create a custom gpt or gemini gems ( i prefer the gems ) and u give him some documentation about prompt engineering + a persona ( like a way to act + respond ) and it'll redifine ur prompt
And for that they have small difference but yes . U can go on some github they did leak the prompt system from windsurf , etc and u can adapt ur prompt
So no really big need of prompt bc it'll basicaly do the work for u
If someone want to really use the power of cursor the minimum is to use smtg like rules + taskmaster ( Claude task master on github ) or the best imo some ppl did release some " agent coding team " ( some issue bc is only the start of it ) .
A tasks.md is a nice idea
but I give it to make a tasks.md and start one step at a time
well that was an example
my actual prompts are more of a paragraph, I also includes things like the file name conventions, function name conventions, package manager, whether I'm using monorepo etc
My prompt is more complex then both of yours. With Guides what to Install, Style references detailed Features. You can try o3 for prompting. You will have much better results whit that.
like
"make me a nice website"
vs
"with tailwind, shadcn ui and blue color scheme, make me a modern chatgpt clone with authentication and db using convex, and use vite with tanstack query for fetching"
but either way the more specific your prompt is, the better the outcome will be
from my experience cursor let's me skip time into future where I would've coded, and others kinda goes through the process with me
cursor's more focused on developers imo
So you think you have to prompt Cursor in a different way then cline or Windsurf or any other vibe Coder out there?
you need to know how to make it yourself to make good prompt with cursor
https://tenor.com/view/fr-lie-gif-9063740662564569899
I used a mixture of agentic methods but I mainly use ColaudePilot, here's the most successful prompt: 
> Hey, make me a website/app that will make me 100 MILLION USD!
Guys! I just vibe coded my way to 100 MILLION USD!
thanks. will try it out
roo code is better than cline ( from my opinion ) + i prefer cursor from claude code for some reason like the price ,etc
maybe they changed something. my last test is a  month ago
even vscode with cline is better then cursor in my opinion
claude code is the best so far
i tried it a few times. And always had incomplete builds, errors and cursors is spinning circles, producing more errors. same as lovable
cursor is not good in my opinion
This is imo one of the best things someone can get
Yep but imo the best thing is cursor u pay basically 20 usd a month for having 500 premium request ( fast call ) and then u get unlimited slow request ( which are not that slow )
yeah lol i come here sometime just to see if ppl need help or smtg else
the api costs are crazy high. i tried deepseek, but always have 500 errors.
so you dont use same.new but help people in their discord?
i developed yesterday a simple video format changer. and it costs  1$. in a vibecoder the same app would cost a few cents
nope, it‚Äôs been a while since I last used this site
and it cost mcuh more then lovable
but mostly i develope local ais. like scraper, seo analyser but all locally
Yeah but like they are really agent team and the only output that u'll need to give to them is a PRD or some a simple brief app / website idea and they'll work after automatically ( like i know some ppl that are letting ai build for 8 hours straight on they pc while they sleep )
i develope everything with claude yolo, deploy with vercel and use supabase for database things
i do. but i hate work üòÑ
But to respond to that why aren't u using agent with cursor ,etc ?
do you know what the 10x monthly tokens for pro means?
3-4 is more then 0 and an outdated bot
i know for sure that on the start and some month after the release of the project they was really active
they are 3-4 support here on the discord so yeah i don't know if u'll get lot of support
<:depressed:1274640139070607444>
i did
maybe delete cookies
lol you cant say R efund here ^^
dude why i keep getting logged back to my account i wanna log outüò≠ it keeps making me log back to my acccount and i cant even disable or delete my own account
they have no support and hundrets of tickets every day
lol mb then
maybe you try to answer a different question ^^ But thanks anyway. Im in the AI game since 2011. I coach companies how to prompt since 2022. That is not my Problem.
A week ago the broke something and nothing works anymore.
Thats why i am here
Note : was for a documentation for a github project
=====================================================================================


To give u a good example of prompt i did build this website by using +/- 10 credits ( i was trying some prompt but with the good prompt that will cost +/- 5-7 credits i thinks ) : https://preview--bmad-web-architect-27.lovable.app/#resources
Don't know if this is clear but ( did enhanced the format with gpt btw): 

> Big companies like **Loveable**(valued in the billions) ‚Äî typically have **more financial flexibility**.
> Their **credit-per-output model** (1 AI response = 1 credit) is honestly one of the best systems out there:
> => It leads to **huge cost savings**, especially since they target **mass-market users**.
> 
> On the other hand, **smaller platforms like Same** don‚Äôt have as many users yet, so they rely on a **more traditional credit model**(which is more expensive )

üëâ So overall, I believe **Loveable is much more cost-effective**, though of course I could be wrong.


But the real game changer is **Prompt Engineering**: 

If you want to get the **most value per credit**, you *need* to learn how to write better prompts.
Here‚Äôs what I recommend:

**1) Look up tutorials** ‚Äî YouTube, Reddit, blogs‚Ä¶ tons of free content out there.

**2) Google released a 64-page PDF** on prompt engineering ‚Äî it‚Äôs gold.
If you're short on time, you can use AI to summarize it for you.

**3) Start a new chat** when the conversation gets too long or context starts to break.
This keeps the model sharp  and **reduces token usage**.

**4) Always send the most detailed and precise prompt you can.**
=> It saves time, avoids back-and-forth, and **maximizes each credit**.
but thats all in supabase. And i know i can do everything myself and use claude code, cursor, cline and vercel for deployement and can manage supabase myself. but the idea of such tools is to not do everything myself.
